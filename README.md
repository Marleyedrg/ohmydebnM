### This is a fork from https://github.com/dougburks/ohmydebn

OhMyDebn requires the following:
- x86_64 or ARM architecture
- 2GB RAM MINIMUM (more is obviously better)
- 2 CPU cores MINIMUM (more is obviously better)
- Debian 13
- non-root user account with sudo privileges
- curl
- ability to connect to Github, package repos, and other Internet sites
  
# Warnings

- OhMyDebn is intended for a clean new installation
- OhMyDebn may make changes to your APT configuration
- OhMyDebn will remove apps like FireFox, Thunderbird, and others (unless you use the `--no-uninstall` option)
- OhMyDebn is a fun project and is not officially supported. If it breaks your system, you get to keep both pieces!

# Installation

For the quickest and easiest installation, the best option is to start with the Debian Live 13 Cinnamon ISO image on x86_64 hardware. If for some reason that doesn't work for your use case, see the alternative installation options below.

1. Download the Debian Live 13 Cinnamon ISO image from https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current-live/amd64/iso-hybrid/ and install it. Reboot into your newly installed Debian 13 Cinnamon and the default desktop should look like this:
![debian-cinnamon screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dougburks/ohmydebn-docs/refs/heads/main/images/debian-cinnamon.png)
2. In your Debian 13 Cinnamon desktop, download the installation script:
```
git clone git@github.com:Marleyedrg/ohmydebn.git
```
3. Once you have reviewed install.sh and the rest of the code in this repo, you can run the install script:
```
cd ohmydebn
bash install.sh 
```
## Installation Options

The installation script supports the following option:

- `--no-uninstall` - installs OhMyDebn without removing existing packages like Firefox, Thunderbird, etc.

Example:
```
bash install.sh --no-uninstall
```
# After Installation

Once installation completes, you can enjoy your new OhMyDebn desktop!
