# How to contribute

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the OhMyDebn project!

# Discuss first

Before you spend any time on a contribution, please start a discussion first to make sure this is not something that is already being worked on and that this is something that can actually be accepted into the project:

https://github.com/dougburks/ohmydebn/discussions/categories/ideas-for-pull-requests

# Create a PR for the `dev` branch

Once the idea is accepted, then you can:
- fork the `dev` branch
- add the changes to your fork
- test your changes
- add documentation to README.md if necessary
- submit a PR for the `dev` branch
