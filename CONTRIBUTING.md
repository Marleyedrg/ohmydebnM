# How to contribute

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the OhMyDebn project!

Before you spend any time on a contribution, please start a discussion first to make sure this is not something that is already being worked on and that this is something that can actually be accepted into the project.

Once the idea is accepted, then you can fork the `dev` branch, add the changes to your fork, test your changes, add documentation to README.md if necessary, and then submit a PR for the `dev` branch.
